        <h1>Air Pollutants Emissions among the World (1922 ~ 2022) </h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The study of air pollutants emissions worldwide from 1922 to 2022 highlights the significant 
          impact of industrialization, urbanization, and environmental policies on air quality. Initially, emissions 
          of pollutants like Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and others increased 
          due to rapid industrial growth, particularly in developed regions. However, stricter regulations and technological 
          advancements in the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to reductions in some emissions, especially in 
          developed countries. Conversely, developing regions have seen rising emissions driven by urbanization and 
          industrial expansion. This timeline illustrates the progress made in improving air quality and the ongoing 
          challenges faced in mitigating pollution globally.</p>

            According to the map, carbon monoxide stands out as the predominant air pollutant globally, with nearly every country 
            exhibiting high emissions levels. This widespread prevalence indicates that carbon monoxide is a significant 
            environmental concern, largely resulting from various sources such as vehicle exhaust, industrial activities, and the 
            burning of fossil fuels. The map highlights how the challenges associated with carbon monoxide pollution are not 
            limited to specific regions, suggesting that concerted global efforts are necessary to mitigate its impact on air 
            quality and public health.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            In contrast, black carbon emerges as one of the least emitted air pollutants worldwide, with relatively lower 
            emissions observed across countries. This pollutant, primarily produced from the incomplete combustion of biomass 
            and fossil fuels, tends to have more localized sources, contributing to its limited global footprint. The variability 
            in industrial practices and energy use among countries may also play a role in the lower emission levels of black 
            carbon. Overall, the map illustrates the complex landscape of air pollutants, underscoring the need for targeted 
            strategies to address the pervasive issue of carbon monoxide while recognizing the relatively lesser challenge posed 
            by black carbon emissions.

            This trellis line chart displays the trends in various air pollutant emissions for different continents over time, 
            using data from 1922 to 2022. It shows the emission levels of six key pollutants: Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulphur 
            Dioxide (SO₂), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Black Carbon (BC), Ammonia (NH₃), and Non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC), 
            all measured in kilotonnes. Users can select a continent (e.g., Asia, Europe, North America) to view how the emission 
            levels of each pollutant have changed over time in that region. This allows for a clear comparison of trends, highlighting 
            variations in emission patterns across different pollutants and regions.

            Based on the pie chart and stacked bar chart, we can observe that in the 19th century, the primary contributors to air
             pollution were emissions from North America and Europe. This trend aligns with the Industrial Revolution, during which
              these regions experienced rapid industrial growth, leading to increased emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, 
              sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. In contrast, in the early 20th century, there was a notable rise in emissions from 
              Asia, as countries in the region began to industrialize at a significant scale, driving up pollutant emissions. This 
              shift reflects Asia's growing role in global industrial production and its impact on air quality.

            Around the 1980s, the graph shows a significant increase in air pollutants in Malaysia. This period marks the 
            start of Malaysia's economic transformation and rapid industrial development, leading to a sharp rise in emissions. 
            Among the pollutants, carbon monoxide (CO) stands out with a particularly noticeable increase, reflecting the 
            country's growing industrial activity, energy consumption, and transportation needs. This surge is aligned with 
            Malaysia's transition into a more manufacturing-based economy, resulting in higher levels of air pollution, especially 
            from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes.
